In a parallel universe...........

# why
- I find the multiverse theory very interesting...
- It's very easy to excuse your current situation as "just the way it is", but if you think about it your potential is infinite. 
- If anything and everything exists in parallel universes, then it proves that you are just as capable of being a billionaire in this universe, as the other ones.
